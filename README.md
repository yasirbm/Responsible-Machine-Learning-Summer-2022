* Lecture 1: Self-explainable Machine Learning Models
* Lecture 2: Post-hoc Explanation
* Lecture 3: Discrimination Testing and Remediation
* Lecture 4: Machine Learning Security
* Lecture 5: Machine Learning Model Debugging
* Lecture 6: Responsible Machine Learning Best Practices



### WIP Instructions and Rubric.
This is a pure technical writing assignment. Very little introduction, narrative, or conclusion text is necessary. You may make copious use of bullet points, charts, and tables. (But remember that all charts and tables should have descriptions!)

Your model card must include the following sections: Intended use, Training data, Evaluation data, Model details, Quantitative analysis, Ethical considerations. The focus of the model card should be your best performing remediated model. You should briey address your other models as \alternative approaches" in the Quantitative analysis section, and point to why your main model is a better choice.

### WIP Rubric:
#### Structure (6 pts.)
* Name and contact information for all group members. (Feel free to anonymize for this assignment. The idea for the real-world is to \sign" your work and make it easy to nd yourself if there are problems in the future, i.e., accountability) (1 pt.)
* Clearly delineated sections for:
  * Intended use ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Training data ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Evaluation data ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Model details ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Quantitative analysis ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Ethical considerations ( 1/2 pt.)
* Correct and informative external links (e.g., to training and evaluation data) ( 1/2 pt.)
* Correct use and introduction of abbreviations ( 1/2 pt.)
* Charts or tables:
  * Meaningful and informative use of charts or tables ( 1/2 pt.)
  * Proper description of charts or tables ( 1/2 pt.)





* Content (13 pts.)

purposes

uation (or test) metrics come from the most recent class full evaluation results, link under
Assignment 1.

that must include the global variable importance and partial dependence of your group's best
remediated model.
* Address other alternative models considered
{ Ethical considerations (2 pts.)

* Describe potential uncertainties relating to the impacts of using your group's best remediated
model:
· Consider math or software problems
· Consider real-world risks: who, what, when and how?
* Describe any unexpected or results encountered during training
